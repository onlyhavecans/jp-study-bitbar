# Japanese Study BitBar Plugins

These are some plugins for helping keep on top of Japanese study resources I use.

## Requirements

You will need to have [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar)

You will need python (you probably already have this on most macs)

## WaniKani (Kanji)

I have no idea how this is the first plugin I have found that uses APIv2.

1. Get your read-only v2 api key [from WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/personal_access_tokens)
1. Put the api key in `~/.config/wanikani.com/api.key` (you may need to make folders)
1. Copy `wanikani.15m.py` into your BitBar Folder (or use the included Enabled!) 

## BunPro (Grammar)

1. Get your api key [from your BunPro settings page](https://bunpro.jp/)
1. Put the api key in `~/.config/bunpro.jp/api.key` (you may need to make folders)
1. Copy `bunpro.15m.py` into your BitBar Folder (or use the included Enabled!)
