# Japanese Study BitBar Plugins

These are some plugins for helping keep on top of Japanese study resources I use.

## WaniKani

I have no idea how this is the first plugin I have found that uses APIv2.

This has no additional requirements other than python which should be on your Mac anyways

1. Get your read-only v2 api key [from WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/personal_access_tokens)
1. Put the api key in `~/.config/wanikani.com/api.key` (you may need to make folders)
1. Copy `wanikani.30m.py` into your BitBar Folder (or use the included Enabled!)
